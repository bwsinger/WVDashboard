Here are a bunch of links on how to do certain things in D3. This file is meant to
give anyone who wants to work on a graph easy access to implementation examples.

If you find any great examples or other resources, feel free to edit the file.

Leaderboard Graph:
- Adding images to the ends of the bars
	- Adding a thing (we want an image, not text) to the end of a bar

		(look under "Adding Text and Axes")
	- Adding an image to a D3 graph

Line Graph:
- Making the summed end_uses line a different color depending on whether it is
  above or below the solar line
  	- The hardish/slow but very effective way (treating the line between each point
  	  as its own segment to allow individual segment coloring)

  	- The easyish/probably faster but dodgy-er way (finding the intersect points and
  	  coloring the svg line using a linear gradient)
