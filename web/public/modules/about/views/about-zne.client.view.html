<p>Calculating ZNE performance goals for each building<br>
In order to determine the target electricity consumption of each of our four buildings, we triangulated four​ sources of data: (1) West Village developer’s modeling of estimated consumption and PV production for each building; (2) ​monthly utility bills reporting net consumption (consumption – production); (3) ​o​nline solar production calculator to estimate monthly proportions of production relative to annual estimated PV production; and (4) baseline data from HOBO ​data ​loggers in each building.</p>

<p>We excluded WCEC labs from 215 Sage ZNE goals and we excluded EV charging from ZNE goals for 1590 Tilia; both were added after initial ZNE planning.</p>
