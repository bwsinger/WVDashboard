<p>West Village Energy Dashboard educates building occupants and visitors about energy flows in the largest planned mixed-use zero net energy (ZNE) development in the US, and the first in California. <a href="http://westvillage.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">Read more about West Village</a>.</p>

<p>West Village has yet to actually achieve ZNE. Behavioral programs to reduce electricity consumption among residents in student housing have met with some success, but no attention has been given to occupant behavior in the commercial spacesâ€¦ until now!</p>

<p>West Village commercial spaces are largely composed of over a dozen energy and transportation research centers.</p>
